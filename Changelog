7/14/23
Added MainGraph.py to report the gold balances that are logged at the end of each day. 
This script will run on the first day of the month once the change of month is detected. 
The script records when it logs, so it will not report twice in the same day.

Edited Main.py call to report graphs after the gold balance has been logged after bootup.
A report is sent for each character there is a graph reported for into each channel found in Channels.py
